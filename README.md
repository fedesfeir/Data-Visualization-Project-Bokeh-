# Student Lifestyle, Stress, and Academic Performance  
*Data Visualization Project (Bokeh)*  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores how different lifestyle factors — **study time, sleep, physical activity, and social activities** — interact with stress levels and affect **academic performance (GPA)**.  

The visualizations were created using **Bokeh** and are accessible at:

## 📂 Dataset  
We used the **[Student Lifestyle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steve1215rogg/student-lifestyle-dataset)** available on Kaggle.  
It contains self-reported measures from students covering:  
- Study hours  
- Sleep hours  
- Physical activity  
- Social activity  
- Stress levels  
- GPA outcomes

## 🔑 Key Findings from the Visualizations  

### 1. Low Stress Students  
- Students with **low stress** dedicate significantly more time to **physical activity** compared to social hours.  
- Physical activity emerges as a **protective factor**, strongly associated with lower stress and healthier routines.  

### 2. High GPA Students  
- High GPA students show a **balanced distribution of activities**.  
- Even under moderate or high stress, they **maintain physical activity** and avoid excessive social hours.  
- This indicates that academic success is often linked to a **structured lifestyle** where exercise helps buffer stress.  

### 3. Low GPA Students  
- Low GPA students typically show **higher social activity** compared to physical activity.  
- Especially under moderate stress, their physical activity levels drop sharply.  
- This imbalance may contribute to both **higher stress** and **poorer academic outcomes**.  

### 4. The Paradox Group (~20% of Students)  
- A distinct subgroup with **contradictory patterns**:  
  - Minimal study time + poor sleep  
  - Excessive physical activity (> 5h/day)  
  - Low GPA and extremely high stress  
- This group shows that **stress is multidimensional**, not solely tied to study load or GPA.  
- It highlights the importance of **holistic student wellness programs** that include sleep, physical activity, and social connection.

## 📊 Visual Insights Included  
- Bubble charts linking **stress levels** with activity type (study, sleep, physical, social).  
- Comparative plots showing differences between **high GPA vs. low GPA students**.  
- Focus on the **Paradox Group** to illustrate lifestyle imbalance and its consequences.

## 💡 Critical Insight  
High performance paired with well-being is achievable only through **balanced lifestyle choices**.  
Institutions should promote this integrated approach, rather than valorizing academic intensity alone.
